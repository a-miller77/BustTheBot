Question: How does the university allocate funds from donations to support various programs and initiatives?
Response: At Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), donors have the flexibility to direct their contributions to specific academic departments, programs, or student organizations. Here's how the allocation process typically works:
Designated Giving: Donors can specify where they want their funds to go. They can choose to support the general use of a department or program, or they can contribute to a restricted fund. Restricted funds may be used for specific purposes such as senior design projects, classroom or lab equipment, or faculty and student development opportunities.
Online Giving Page: When making a gift through MSOE's online giving page, donors can select "other" and write in the department, program, or organization they wish to support.
Impact of Giving: The funds are then utilized according to the donor's wishes to enhance the educational experience at MSOE, whether it's through updating facilities, providing resources for projects, or supporting student and faculty development.
Strategic Investment Fund: MSOE also has a Strategic Investment Fund, which supports innovative projects that can diversify revenue streams or offer new opportunities. Proposals for funding are reviewed by a committee, and if approved, the funds are allocated to cover the initiative's costs until it becomes self-sustaining.
By allowing donors to specify their preferences, MSOE ensures that the generosity of its supporters directly impacts the areas they are most passionate about, fostering a culture of philanthropy and advancing the university's strategic mission.
